Methodology
This model takes input from the webcam of your computer and, at each timestep, performs the following steps:

Pre-processing:

Removes noise from the image.
Crops the image to focus only on the region of interest (hand area).
Edge Detection:

Uses Cannyâ€™s Edge Detection to identify the boundaries of the hand.
Feature Extraction:

Applies Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to extract useful features from the edge-detected image.
Gesture Prediction:

Uses the extracted HOG features as input to a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify the gesture.
This model enables real-time hand gesture recognition for various applications.
